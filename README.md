# 🚀 Python Learning Journey

Welcome to my Python learning repository! This collection of programs represents the beginning of my programming journey, demonstrating fundamental concepts through practical examples and a comprehensive mini-project.

## 📋 Learning Overview

This repository contains 5 Python programs that build progressively from basic syntax to advanced concepts:

- **Day 1**: Introduction to basic syntax and user interaction
- **Day 2**: Completing all foundational concepts and integration in a comprehensive mini-project

## 📚 Programs Overview

### 🎯 **01_hello_world_input.py** - Basic Syntax & User Interaction (Day 1)
**Key Concepts Learned:**
- `print()` statements and output formatting
- `input()` function for user interaction
- String concatenation (`+`) and f-string formatting (`f""`)
- Basic variable assignment

**Program Description:**
A welcoming program that greets users and collects basic information, demonstrating how to read and display user input.

### 🐕 **02_dog_health_checker.py** - Variables & Conditionals (Day 2)
**Key Concepts Learned:**
- Multiple variable types: `str`, `int`, `bool`
- Conditional logic with `if`/`elif`/`else`
- Boolean operators: `and`, `not`
- Arithmetic operations in print statements
- Multi-condition logic trees

**Program Description:**
Analyzes a dog's condition based on weight, hunger, and tiredness levels, providing appropriate recommendations using nested conditional statements.

---

### 😊 **03_mood_based_responses.py** - Multiple Conditionals (Day 2)
**Key Concepts Learned:**
- Multiple separate `if` statements
- String comparison operations
- Appropriate responses based on user input
- Handling different emotional states programmatically

**Program Description:**
An emotional support program that responds differently to user feelings (good, sad, mad, excited, bored) with encouraging messages.

### 🍋 **04_lemonade_stand_calculator.py** - Arithmetic & Variables (Day 2)
**Key Concepts Learned:**
- Mathematical operations: multiplication, subtraction
- Variable computation and reuse
- Financial calculations: revenue, cost, profit
- Print formatting with variables

**Program Description:**
A business calculator that determines profitability for a lemonade stand, showing how to perform and display financial computations.

### 🤖 **05_smart_dog_assistant.py** - **MINI PROJECT** (Day 2)
**Key Concepts Learned:**
- **Integration of all previous concepts**
- Advanced user input validation
- Type conversion (`input()` to `int`/`float`)
- Complex conditional logic
- Structured program design
- Multi-step user interaction
- Boolean conversion from user input

**Program Description:**
A comprehensive dog care assistant that collects multiple pieces of information and provides personalized recommendations. This program brings together all the skills learned throughout the journey!

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run the Programs

Each Python file can be run individually:

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd learning-to-code-python.-

# Run any program (replace filename)
python 01_hello_world_input.py
python 02_dog_health_checker.py
python 03_mood_based_responses.py
python 04_lemonade_stand_calculator.py
python 05_smart_dog_assistant.py
```
